# Cellular-Automata

> *“Cellular automata have been invented many times under different names…
> In pure mathematics they can be recognized as a branch of topological dynamics,
> in electrical engineering they are sometimes called iterative arrays, 
> and high school kids may know them as a sort of home-computer game.
> They have been used and abused by interdisciplinary scientists 
> as well as interdisciplinary bumblers.”* <br> <br>
